# Current Project State and Development Priorities

## Working Components ✅
- **Claude Wrapper**: OPERATIONAL at localhost:8000
  - FastAPI service with OpenAI API compatibility
  - OAuth authentication via macOS Keychain
  - Health endpoint and model listing functional
  - Message format conversion (OpenAI ↔ Claude)

- **Basic AutoGen Integration**: OPERATIONAL
  - Single agent conversations working
  - Model client configuration functional
  - AssistantAgent and basic workflows tested

- **AutoGen Studio**: CONFIGURED
  - Database and configuration files present
  - Ready for GUI-based agent prototyping

- **Sequential-Graphiti Hook**: OPERATIONAL
  - Knowledge capture automation in place
  - Synthesis workflow for thought processing

## Incomplete Components ⚠️
- **Multi-Agent Patterns**: PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED
  - Sequential chat: Working
  - Group chat: NOT_IMPLEMENTED (RoundRobinGroupChat, SelectorGroupChat)
  - Nested chat: NOT_IMPLEMENTED
  - Missing functions in `/autogen/examples/multi_agent_examples.py`

- **Error Recovery**: NEEDS_IMPLEMENTATION
  - No retry logic for wrapper disconnections
  - Timeout handling needs improvement
  - Graceful degradation not implemented

- **Integration Tests**: NOT_CREATED
  - No comprehensive test suite for multi-agent patterns
  - Performance validation missing
  - End-to-end testing incomplete

- **AutoGen Bench Integration**: PLANNED
  - Performance benchmarking not yet implemented
  - No automated validation against performance thresholds

## Critical Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete Multi-Agent Examples** (CRITICAL)
   - Implement `group_chat_example()` using RoundRobinGroupChat
   - Implement `nested_chat_example()` for complex workflows
   - Location: `/autogen/examples/multi_agent_examples.py`

2. **Add Error Recovery** (HIGH)
   - Wrapper reconnection logic in `/autogen/config.py`
   - Timeout handling for long conversations
   - Graceful degradation when services unavailable

3. **Create Integration Tests** (HIGH)
   - Test suite for all orchestration patterns
   - Error condition testing
   - Performance baseline validation

4. **AutoGen Bench Integration** (MEDIUM)
   - Set up agbench for performance validation
   - Create custom benchmarks for meta-development tasks
   - Automate performance regression testing

## Development Constraints
- **Local Only**: OAuth requires macOS Keychain, no Docker support
- **AutoGen Native**: Must use v0.6.X native features exclusively
- **Model Support**: Limited to claude-opus-4-20250514, claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- **Performance Targets**: <700ms response time, <500MB memory usage

## Verification Before Development
Always run these commands before starting work:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health          # Wrapper operational
claude auth status                         # OAuth working
cd autogen && python quickstart.py        # Basic integration
```

## Research Requirements
Before implementing any feature, MUST research AutoGen capabilities:
```bash
mcp__autogen-docs__fetch_autogen_documentation
mcp__autogen-docs__search_autogen_documentation query:"[feature]"
```

## Success Metrics
- All 13+ AutoGen native patterns implemented and tested
- >80% success rate on AutoGen Bench evaluations
- Zero custom framework implementations
- 100% CloudEvents compliance for event handling
- All agents prototyped in AutoGen Studio first
